        Mood Journal app logs your mobility, mood, and phone usage information. Mobility and phone interaction
        traces are collected in the background. The app samples your contextual information such as location, 
        WiFi connectivity, current physical activity and notification details including arrival time, 
        response time, seen time, sender app name and title. However, to collect your mood logs the 
        app will trigger one mood related questionnaire in a day. All the personal information will be anonymised, and securely transmitted and stored on the server. No additional information related to
        contacts \(telephone numbers, email addresses etc.\) on your device or history of communication made with the 
        contact made would be collected by the application.

        Do you know that mood &amp; emotion really affect the decisions you make every day? In fact, being emotionally aware
        is really important. We want to help you be more aware of your mood &amp; emotion by creating daily mood reporting
        as new habit.

        \n\nResearch has shown that forming new habits is easier when you create a strategic plan called implementation
        intention, by specifying when, where, and how you will execute your goal: \"If Y happens, I will do Z!\".
        And this app will guide you setup an implementation intention.

        \n\nWe will start by identifying your existing routine which you will be used as a trigger.
        Remember that just after the routine occurs, make sure to report your mood immediately. Repeat this process every day.
