        Task Journal helps you to keep track of your task completion everyday. The app will trigger one self-report diary questionnaire every day.
        All the personal information will be anonymised, securely transmitted and stored on the server.
        No additional information related to contacts \(telephone numbers, email addresses etc.\) on your device
        or history of communication made with the contact would be collected by the application.
        The app is developed to collect data for research at University of Birmingham.

        Do you know that tracking your task regularly could improve your productivity?
        We will help you form a good habit of tracking your task every day by creating a plan called as implementation intention.

        \n\nImplementation intention is effective in helping form new habits by specifying the condition
